## Namespaces

The namespaces correspond to the .NET namespace counterpart.

Examples:

|.NET                        |Foundation                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
|`System`                    |`Foundation`                    |
|`System.Collections.Generic`|`Foundation.Collections.Generic`|
|`System.ComponentModel`     |`Foundation.ComponentModel`     |
|`System.IO`                 |`Foundation.IO`                 |


The namespaces are based on Microsoft .NET namespaces. It is easy for a .NET developer to find a particular component because of the familiar namespace scheme.
